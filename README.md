# PID Neural Ordinary Differential Equations

This is the official implementation of PID Neural Ordinary Differential Equations. 

## Main requirements
The code base in in Python. The following packages are required:
- torch
- torchvision
- torchdiffeq
- tqdm
- imageio
- einops
These packages can be installed with the following command:
```
pip install torch torchvision torchdiffeq tqdm imageio einops
```
Additionally, if you want to run the visualization code, the ```numpy```, ```pandas```, ```matplotlib``` are also required. These are well-supported package, so if there's any problem with the installation process, please refer to the official installation guide.
